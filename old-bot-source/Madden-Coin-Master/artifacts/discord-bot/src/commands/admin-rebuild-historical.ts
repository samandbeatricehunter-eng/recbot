 * Deletes the historical records channel for the current season and rebuilds it
 * from scratch, re-posting:
 *  - Season recap article (historical channel only — no @everyone in headlines)
 *  - In-game award winners (display only — no coin bonuses re-issued)
 *  - Stat leaders (top 3 per category)
 *  - Playoff picture / division winners (with W-L and point differentials)
 *  - Community polls (loudest mouth top-5 by message count; most heart top-5+bottom-5)
 *
 * PR bonuses and GOTY poll are NOT re-run (they were already issued).
